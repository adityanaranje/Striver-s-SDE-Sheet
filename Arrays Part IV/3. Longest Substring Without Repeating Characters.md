### Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


#### Diff: Medium


#### Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

#### Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"

Output: 1

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

#### Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

#### Constraints:

> 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104

> s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


#### Solution:
          class Solution:
              def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
                  if len(s)==0:
                      return 0

                  sset = set()

                  left = 0
                  right = 0
                  long = 0

                  while right < len(s):
                      if s[right] in sset:
                          sset.remove(s[left])
                          left+=1
                      else:
                          sset.add(s[right])
                          long = max(long, right-left+1)
                          right+=1

                  return long
